# Day 1

Today I created my project in Godot, setup Godot hackatime, created a level with coins, platforms, moving platforms, killzones, and an end point. I uploaded assets such as sprites, tilesets, sounds, music, and fonts (credits and license in folder). I also added music, sound effects, and animations.

I logged 5h 14m of progress and got the first level and the HUD done.

# Day 2

Today I created level 2, changed the logic for the music, added spikes and cacti, I added a death animation, added fans to the platforms, created a title screen, added a death screen, uploaded a demo to itch.io, and started working on level 3.

I logged 4h 26m of progress and have a playable demo with a title screen and 2 levels.

# Day 3

Today, I logged 1h 3m of progress and added a death screen and level clear screens.
